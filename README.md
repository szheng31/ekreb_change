<h3> Prerequisites</h3>

 - [node.js](nodejs.org/en/download) 
 - antd `npm install antd`
 - axios `npm install axios`

<h3> Commands </h3>
In the project directory, to start the backend run:

    node ./backend/index.js

To start the front end run, go into the ./frontend directory and run:

    npm run dev


<h3>Reflection</h3>
This project was both really frustrating and really fun to work on, due to me having no experience with React whatsoever. I struggled with the backend and frontend communication, with problems I couldn't figure out online. However, after spending some more time and getting more familiar with JS and axios, I really enjoyed working through the problems I encountered. If I had more time, I would want to add more statistics, a wordle-like input, and more styling.
